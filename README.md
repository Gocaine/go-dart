# Build

First of all, ensure you have checked out the project in `${GOPATH}/github.com/gocaine/go-dart`.

Simply run the command `make binary`

As the build process relies on docker, please first configure it on your local.

If you don't want to use docker, simply run `make dev binary` rely on your local version of `go` and `npm`.

If you want to prepare a binary for ARM, run `make arm binary`

To deploy on the rpi run `make deploy`. In order, you must add the rpi host name and its associated ip to your network configuration (DNS or /etc/hosts)

If you want to build the binary without rebuilding the frontend, run `make binary-noui`. It will ship the previously built version.


## Running on a raspberry pi

After you publish the binary on your rpi (default deploy is in the home directory of the pi user), you can run the following commands: 

 - `./clean-i2c.sh`: this will clean up and reset the GPIO ports direction and status
 - `sudo ./go-dart hardware -b <board-id>`: this will start the software responsible to listenning the hardware and propagating the dart events to the server
 - `./go-dart server`: this starts a game server

## Accessing the server

The latest stable version of the server is reachable at this address: https://go-dart.mabreizh.fr/
